## ðŸ”¹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Jimmir Miranda** â€” a forward-thinking **full-stack web developer** and **creative problem solver**.

I help businesses, startups, and solo entrepreneurs build **scalable digital solutions** and run their operations more efficiently. Whether you need a custom-built app, a reliable virtual assistant, or a creative asset that stands out â€” I deliver with precision and care.

My background in **music composition, audio engineering**, and **video editing** gives me a unique creative edge, while my technical expertise allows me to develop full-stack applications using modern frameworks like **Next.js, React, TRPC**, and **Spring Boot**.

Iâ€™m currently building a strong remote freelance business and scaling through automation, smart client systems, and results-driven execution.
